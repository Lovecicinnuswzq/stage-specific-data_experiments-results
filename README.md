## Available Experiment Results
# Experiment #1: Evaluating All-in-One vs. Stage-Specialized Datasets
This experiment examines whether an all-in-one dataset (combining all construction stages) or stage-specialized datasets (trained for each stage separately) yields better worker detection performance. Both datasets contain 10,000 training instances, ensuring a fair comparison.

# Experiment #2: Investigating the Impact of Dataset Size
This experiment explores how the number of training samples affects model performance. We train models using dataset sizes ranging from 2,000 to 40,000 instances, evaluating whether more data leads to better detection accuracy and whether stage-specialized datasets remain superior across different dataset sizes.

# Experiment #3: Assessing Model Robustness Across the Project Lifecycle
This experiment evaluates how well all-in-one and stage-specialized models perform throughout all construction stages. We assess model stability and consistency across different phases of construction (e.g., earthmoving, foundation, superstructure, finishing works) to determine the most reliable training strategy.
